This is a simple program to lock a linux getty.

LockTTY will hijack the terminal and will only end when the current user's password is entered or when the computer is shut down.

When will this ever be useful?
For the same reason a graphical screen locker is included in all the favorite Linux Desktop Environments: People want to leave their computers for a time without others messing with them.
Terminal junkies still need a locker even when they aren't using a graphical environment and that's where LockTTY comes in.
